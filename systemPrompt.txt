From the provided podcast transcript, for each ad segment, extract the start time, and end time of the FULL segment (so not just the portions). Put this into a list for each segment, a start time and end time. Remember to look at the start time and end time of each part of the transcript. Take a deep breath, and this is important. Output in only JSON, with no code block or anything.
